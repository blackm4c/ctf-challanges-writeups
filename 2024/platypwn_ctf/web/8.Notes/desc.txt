What would be a CTF without a note-taking application web challenge? So of course we’ve got you covered!

Notes is a cute, tiny, and modern huge Java app, featuring lots of cursed code on enterprise level. If you think that you could build an identical app with only half as much code using any other language, you are right. But then, the challenge would be only half as fun as it is now…

Your task is simple: Read trough the roughly 600 lines of Java code (it would be a shame if I put all that effort into the challenge and no one enjoys my code), understand the application, find the vulnerability and snatch the admin’s cookie!
